# Company Research

## Tool Restriction (Critical)

ONLY use `web_search_advanced_exa`. Do NOT use `web_search_exa` or any other Exa tools.

## Token Isolation (Critical)

Never run Exa searches in main context. Always spawn Task agents:
- Agent runs Exa search internally
- Agent processes results using LLM intelligence
- Agent returns only distilled output (compact JSON or brief markdown)
- Main context stays clean regardless of search volume

## Dynamic Tuning

No hardcoded numResults. Tune to user intent:
- User says "a few" → 10-20
- User says "comprehensive" → 50-100
- User specifies number → match it
- Ambiguous? Ask: "How many companies would you like?"

## Query Variation

Exa returns different results for different phrasings. For coverage:
- Generate 2-3 query variations
- Run in parallel
- Merge and deduplicate

## Categories

Use appropriate Exa `category` depending on what you need:
- `company` → homepages, rich metadata (headcount, location, funding, revenue)
- `news` → press coverage, announcements
- `tweet` → social presence, public commentary
- `people` → LinkedIn profiles (public data)
- No category (`type: "auto"`) → general web results, deep dives, broader context

Start with `category: "company"` for discovery, then use other categories or no category with `livecrawl: "fallback"` for deeper research.

### Category-Specific Filter Restrictions

When using `category: "company"`, these parameters cause 400 errors:
- `includeDomains` / `excludeDomains`
- `startPublishedDate` / `endPublishedDate`
- `startCrawlDate` / `endCrawlDate`

When searching without a category (or with `news`), domain and date filters work fine.

**Universal restriction:** `includeText` and `excludeText` only support **single-item arrays**. Multi-item arrays cause 400 errors across all categories.

## LinkedIn

Public LinkedIn via Exa: `category: "people"`, no other filters.
Auth-required LinkedIn → use Claude in Chrome browser fallback.

## Browser Fallback

Auto-fallback to Claude in Chrome when:
- Exa returns insufficient results
- Content is auth-gated
- Dynamic pages need JavaScript

## Models

- haiku: fast extraction (listing, discovery)
- opus: synthesis, analysis, browser automation

## Examples

### Discovery: find companies in a space
```
web_search_advanced_exa {
  "query": "AI infrastructure startups San Francisco",
  "category": "company",
  "numResults": 20,
  "type": "auto"
}
```

### Deep dive: research a specific company
```
web_search_advanced_exa {
  "query": "Anthropic funding rounds valuation 2024",
  "type": "deep",
  "livecrawl": "fallback",
  "numResults": 10,
  "includeDomains": ["techcrunch.com", "crunchbase.com", "bloomberg.com"]
}
```

### News coverage
```
web_search_advanced_exa {
  "query": "Anthropic AI safety",
  "category": "news",
  "numResults": 15,
  "startPublishedDate": "2024-01-01"
}
```

### LinkedIn profiles
```
web_search_advanced_exa {
  "query": "VP Engineering AI infrastructure",
  "category": "people",
  "numResults": 20
}
```

## Output Format

Return:
1) Results (structured list; one company per row)
2) Sources (URLs; 1-line relevance each)
3) Notes (uncertainty/conflicts)
